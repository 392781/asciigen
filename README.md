# asciigen - ASCII Art Generator
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/392781/asciigen/master/imgs/banner.png"/>

Will generate ASCII art based on an input image.

## Progress
* Generates random ASCII characters from a predefined table of brightness to create image
* Reading font bitmaps to determine brightness values
* Optimized font analyzer (work in progress)
* Improved brightness range of ASCII table (work in progress)

## Working on
* Rewriting code to be used as a library instead of as a list of functions (v0.2.0)
* Implementation of SSIM

## Backburner
* Color
* Adjusting analyzer and brightness ranges
